## Maker Map

### Getting Started
`themakermap.com` is deployed as a static site using Github Pages. That said, in order to work on the project, you'll want to ensure that you have a few tools setup a ready to go:

- Install [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/)
- Install [LESS](http://lesscss.org/) using [NPM](https://npmjs.org/) `npm install -g less`

### To Build
```bash
npm install
```
